    Fingerprints provided an elegant and cost effective solution to the Equality problem in communication complexity. Their quantum counterparts, are one of the examples where exponential seperation exists between classical and quantum communication costs, driving years of subsequent work with many interesting applications. Moreover recent publications show efficient ways to construct and work with quantum fingerprints on practice. Apart from the savings in communication costs, quantum fingerprints have an extra, inherent feature: the ability to hide information. This thesis will review quantum fingerprints both as a communication complexity asset and a crypto-primitive, as well as an experimental implementation that might render quantum fingerprints as the future of quantum communication.
