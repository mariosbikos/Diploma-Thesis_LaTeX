We refer one to the original survey for descriptions of potential applications (such as medical visualization, maintenance and repair of complex equipment, annotation, and path planning); summaries of AR system characteristics (such as the advantages and disadvantages of optical and video approaches to blending virtual and real, problems in display focus and contrast, and system portability); and an introduction to the crucial problem of registration, including sources of registration error and error-reduction strategies},

Instead of a marker, we use the human hand as a distinctive pattern that almost all wearable computer users have readily available. We present a robust real-time algorithm that recognizes fingertips to reconstruct the six-degree-of-freedom camera pose relative to the user's outstretched hand. A hand pose model is constructed in a one-time calibration step by measuring the fingertip positions in presence of ground-truth scale information. Through frame-by-frame reconstruction of the camera pose relative to the hand, we can stabilize 3D graphics annotations on top of the hand, allowing the user to inspect such virtual objects conveniently from different viewing angles in AR. We evaluate our approach with regard to speed and accuracy, and compare it to state-of-the-art marker-based AR systems. We demonstrate the robustness and usefulness of our approach in an example AR application for selecting and inspecting world-stabilized virtual objects.},

The potential uses of this technology are numerous, from architecture and medicine, to manufacturing and entertainment. Vision-based techniques which augment objects onto predetermined planar patterns are considered the most promising approach for achieving accurate registrations, but the majority of the proposed methods fail to provide any robustness to significant changes in pattern scale, orientation, or partial pattern occlusion. This thesis presents the design and implementation of a robust pattern-based augmentation system that addresses these problems, and analyzes its performance using standard consumer-level hardware. Known planar patterns are tracked in a real-time video feed, and virtual 2D and 3D objects are accurately augmented onto these patterns based on the plane’s orientation. A method to achieve perspective-correct augmentations without the need for a manual camera calibration procedure is also described.},

In the future, more and more everyday-life videos will be shot from a first-person point of view, overturning the classical fixed-camera understanding of Vision, specializing the existing knowledge of moving cameras and bringing new challenges in the field of video processing. The trend in research is going to be oriented towards a new type of computer vision, centred on moving sensors and driven by the need for new applications for wearable devices. We identify hand tracking and gesture recognition as an essential topic in this field, motivated by the simple realization that we often look at our hand, even while performing the simplest tasks in everyday life. In addition, the next frontier in user interfaces are hands-free devices. In this work we argue that applications based on FPV may involve information fusion at various complexity and abstraction levels, ranging from pure image processing to inference over patterns.We address the lowest, by proposing a first investigation on hand detection from a first-person point of view sensor and some preliminary results obtained fusing colour and optic flow information.},

Three main contributions are presented. First, we propose an algorithm for generating configurable marker dictionaries (in size and number of bits) following a criterion to maximize the inter-marker distance and the number of bit transitions. In the process, we derive the maximum theoretical inter-marker distance that dictionaries of square binary markers can have. Second, a method for automatically detecting the markers and correcting possible errors is proposed. Third, a solution to the occlusion problem in augmented reality applications is shown. To that aim, multiple markers are combined with an occlusion mask calculated by color segmentation. The experiments conducted show that our proposal obtains dictionaries with higher inter-marker distances and lower false negative rates than state-of-the-art systems, and provides an effective solution to the occlusion problem.},

abstract = {In order for natural interaction in Augmented Reality (AR) to become widely adopted, the techniques used need to be shown to support precise interaction, and the gestures used proven to be easy to understand and perform. Recent research has explored free-hand gesture interaction with AR interfaces, but there have been few formal evaluations conducted with such systems. In this paper we introduce and evaluate two natural interaction techniques: the free-hand gesture based Grasp-Shell, which provides direct physical manipulation of virtual content; and the multi-modal Gesture-Speech, which combines speech and gesture for indirect natural interaction. These techniques support object selection, 6 degree of freedom movement, uniform scaling, as well as physics-based interaction such as pushing and flinging. We conducted a study evaluating and comparing Grasp-Shell and Gesture-Speech for fundamental manipulation tasks. The results show that Grasp-Shell outperforms Gesture-Speech in both efficiency and user preference for translation and rotation tasks, while Gesture-Speech is better for uniform scaling. They could be good complementary interaction methods in a physics-enabled AR environment, as this combination potentially provides both control and interactivity in one interface. We conclude by discussing implications and future directions of this research. Keywords:},

Using the agreement found among gestures, a user-defined gesture set was created to guide designers to achieve consistent user-centered gestures in AR. Wobbrock’s surface taxonomy has been extended to cover dimensionalities in AR and with it, characteristics of collected gestures have been derived. Common motifs which arose from the empirical findings were applied to obtain a better understanding of users’ thought and behavior.

abstract = {Several studies have been carried out on augmented reality (AR)-based environments that deal with user interfaces for manipulating and interacting with virtual objects aimed at improving immersive feeling and natural interaction. Most of these studies have utilized AR paddles or AR cubes for interactions. However, these interactions overly constrain the users in their ability to directly manipulate AR objects and are limited in providing natural feeling in the user interface. This paper presents a novel approach to natural and intuitive interactions through a direct hand touchable interface in various AR-based user experiences. It combines markerless augmented reality with a depth camera to effectively detect multiple hand touches in an AR space. Furthermore, to simplify hand touch recognition, the point cloud generated by Kinect is analyzed and filtered out. The proposed approach can easily trigger AR interactions, and allows users to experience more intuitive and natural sensations and provides much control efficiency in diverse AR environments. Furthermore, it can easily solve the occlusion problem of the hand and arm region inherent in conventional AR approaches through the analysis of the extracted point cloud. We present the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach by demonstrating several implementation results such as interactive AR car design and touchable AR pamphlet. We also present an analysis of a usability study to compare the proposed approach with other well-known AR interactions. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we propose a bimanual hand tracking system that provides physically-motivated 6-DOF control for 3D assembly. First, we discuss a set of princi- ples that guide the design of our precise, easy-to-use, and comfortable-to-use system. Based on these guidelines, we describe a 3D input metaphor that supports constraint spec- ification classically used in CAD software, is based on only a few simple gestures, lets users rest their elbows on their desk, and works alongside the keyboard and mouse. Our approach uses two consumer-grade webcams to observe the user’s hands. We solve the pose estimation problem with ef- ficient queries of a precomputed database that relates hand silhouettes to their 3D configuration. We demonstrate effi- cient 3Dmechanical assembly of several CAD models using our hand-tracking system.},
